## 1. **What they are**

### **Chromium**

- It’s the **open-source base project**.
- Anyone can view, modify, or use its code.
- Used as the foundation for browsers like Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera.

### **Google Chrome**

- Built **on top of Chromium**, but includes **extra Google features**.
- Closed-source components are added.

## 3. Why your issue got solved with Chromium

Even though both are similar:

- **Chromium is “clean”** → no custom settings, extensions, or policies.
- Some platforms detect Chromium differently than Chrome.
- Chromium doesn’t come with Google-specific restrictions or disabled flags.
- Better compatibility with screen capture APIs in some controlled setups.

So if the assessment tool couldn’t access screen-sharing through your Chrome installation (because of flags, permissions, policies, or version quirks), installing Chromium offered a fresh, default environment that just worked.

## 4. Which one should you use?

- For **normal daily use**: Google Chrome
- For **testing, development, or bypassing restrictions**: Chromium
- For **privacy-focused browsing**: Chromium (or Brave)
